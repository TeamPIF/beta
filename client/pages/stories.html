                        I used to spend hours sitting outside shops feeling ashamed for having to beg for money to eat. Now, I can
                        walk into a shop and get a meal while I spend my time finding ways to provide for myself. I'm so grateful for
                        this organization and one day I want to be the one donating. We're all human and we should care for one another.

                        I was at my favorite Taco shop today in the Ithaca Commons. When I got to the checkout I paid
                        and saw a tablet that asked if I’d like to donate a meal by paying for it now so a homeless
                        person could it later. I just about teared up on the spot. I pressed a button to donate a taco
                        and I even got to leave a comment for the person. When I went home and ate, the tacos tasted better
                        than ever because I knew my donation would feed someone that night. To the person who needed it,
                        I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did!
