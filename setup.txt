|*********** Environment Set Up Instructions ***********|

MySQL Installation:
1)  If you have never used a MySQL server locally on your computer before,
    to check whether or not you have it installed, type:
    a)  which mysql.server --> if you see something like "/usr/local/bin/mysql.server",
        that means you have the mysql.server command in your path
        i)  to start the server --> mysql.server start
        ii) to stop the server --> mysql.server stop
    b)  which mysqld --> if you see a path show up, that means you have
        the mysqld command in your path
        i)  to start the server --> mysqld (or mysqld_safe)
        ii) to stop the server --> mysql.server stop (or lsof -i | grep mysql, then kill process)

2) To change the password for the 'root' user:
    a)  USE mysql;
    b)  UPDATE user SET password=PASSWORD('your_new_password') WHERE User='root'; (5.6)
    c)  ALTER USER user IDENTIFIED BY 'your_new_password'; (5.7)
    d)  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    e)  quit;

Getting the Code:
    a)  Navigate to the directory of your choice
    b)  Run the following commands:
        i)   git clone git@github.com:TeamPIF/beta.git
        ii)  git branch                         --> * master
        iii) git branch -a                      --> * master, origin/dev
        iv)  git checkout -b dev origin/dev     --> Switched to a new branch 'dev'
        v)   git checkout master
        vi)  cd beta/server, follow the next section

MySQL Database Initialization:
3)  To run the InitMVP.sql script, run the following command:
    a)  'mysql -u root -p << /path/to/InitMVP.sql'
        i)   If you get the message 'bash: mysql: command not found', that means
             you don't have the mysql toolkit installed.  If you have homebrew,
             run the commands:
        ii)  brew udpate
        iii) brew doctor
        iv)  brew upgrade
        v)   brew install mysql
    b)  if the command is successful, it will prompt you for the password, then
        you should be in!

Starting (and Testing) Backend:
4) To run the backend, navigate to beta/server, and run the commands:
    a)  npm install *****(do the same in beta/client)*****
    b)  ./startDev to start the development server, contained in devServer.js,
    which is meant for testing and screwing around with endpoints
    c)  ./starProd to start the production server, contained in server.js,
    which is meant for production code only
        i) If you don't have node or npm, see https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node
    d)  Note, the dev server is on port 8070, and production is on 8080

Starting Frontend:
5)  To start the frontend, navigate to beta/client, and run the command:
    a)  ./serve --> this will start a python server on port 8000, and is more of
        a convenience than a necessity.  If you have python 3.x, change the code
        in serve to: 'python -m http.server -8000'
